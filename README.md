# Ziggurat Bot
## Sends SMS reminders at regular intervals to the inhabitants of Ziggurat House

### How to use this app
- sign up for a free [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com) account
- add your Twilio credentials as environment variables wherever you are running this from
- use `invoke` to run the task you want to run. I use Heroku to schedule these tasks at useful intervals.
- get reminders right to your phone, don't forget to do stuff
